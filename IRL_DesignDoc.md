# IRL Design Doc

## Components

- [x] Configure coding environment
- [x] Data preprocessing (data file loading, dataset cleaning)
- [ ] Implement RL training code
  - [x] Set the game environment to use customized layout
  - [x] Add the Dummy agent to the pair of agents playing the game
  - [ ] Change the reward evaluation method to customized reward function
  - [ ] Test the correctness of the code (agents learning, layout correctly loaded, etc.)
  - [ ] Tune the hyperparameters for training
- [ ] IRL implementation
  - [ ] Code that initializes the IRL training environment
  - [ ] Training code using Pytorch and the RL training code
  - [ ] Add util methods for loading and automatically saving the models
  - [ ] Test the correctness of the code (reward function converges, RL agent learning the rewards, etc.)
